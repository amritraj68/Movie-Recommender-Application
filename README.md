# Movie-Recommender-Application

Recommendation systems are the systems that helps users discover the items they like. 

Recommendation Systems are a type of information filtering systems as they improve the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item or are related to the search history of the user. In this project, I have given the code for the Movie search on the dataset, classifying movies based on the genre of the movie and recommending the similar movies to the user as per his preference


The DataSet that is being used can be downloaded from the link : https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset
